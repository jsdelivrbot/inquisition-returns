![40 martyrs of Sebaste's Quote](https://servone.wspecs.com/wspecs/full/sebaste.jpg)
## Intro
In 313 A.D., Constantine enacted the Edict of Milan. In this Edict he guaranteed the free worship of the gods. Christianity became a legal religion and persecution was abolished. Licinius, the emperor of eastern Rome, agreed with Constantine and upheld the decree. However, Lucinius abandoned this agreement once the political tension between the two empires flared up again. A devout pagan, Lucinius decided to uproot Christianity from eastern Rome. He quickly ordered the removal of Christian soldiers from his military.

## Paganism Revived
The decision of Licinius restored the authority of the pagan leaders. At Sebaste, modern-day Silvas, Turkey, idolatry was reinstated. Agricola, a military command and zealous champion of idolatry, required all soldiers under his authority to bring sacrifices to the pagan gods. Forty of his courageous soldiers, distinguished in battle, refused to obey this command. These devoted soldiers of the empire reserved their utmost devotion and allegiance to Christ. 

## Command to Sacrifice to Idols
Agricola resorted to flattery. He praised the courage and bravery of his generals. He highlights their valor, their youth, their strength, and their aptitude in battle. He encouraged them to sacrifice the idols and to renounce Christ. But the zany soldiers remained faithful to Christ and did not renounce. The impatient Agricola demanded that speaking to them to “either offer sacrifice to the gods and earn great honors, or, in the event of your disobedience, be stripped of your military rank and fall into disgrace.” To this offer his soldiers responded: “Take not only our military insignia, but also our lives, since nothing is more precious to us than Christ God.”

## Trials
These faithful soldiers were imprisoned and tried by Lucius. The judge, Lucius, arrived in Sebaste seven days after the incident. He continued with Agricola’s adulations, hoping to persuade the 40 uncooperative soldiers. All attempts failed. Licius ordered the stoning of the forty. All stones thrown at the soldiers missed their target. Instead, some stones the hit unintended targets. For instance, Lucius threw a stone that veered and landed in the face of Agricola, smashing his teeth. The attackers acknowledged that their soldiers were protected by an invisible power. Upon this realization, Lucius decided to freeze them to death on the next day.

## Comfort
The soldiers spent their night in prayer and received comforting promised from scripture. They were reminded that Christ is the resurrection, and whoever “believes in [him], though he die, yet shall he live.” To be brave and fear not was their motto. An overcoming faith reassured them by Cyrion, one of the 40, that
> “God had miraculously helped them in time of battle and assured them that He would not forsake them now in their battle against the invisible enemy.”

## Punishment
In the frozen winter night, the forty were led to the freezing water of a nearby lake. In the windy weather, stripped of clothing, they had to stand to their death unless they recanted their position. A guard was set to watch them. Warm baths on the side of the lake were made ready for anyone who wishes to change their mind. All forty except for one stood firm in the frosty wind. The cruel weather forced and overpowered one of the soldiers into surrender. The soldier quickly made it to the warm bath simply to meet his unexpected death. Seeing this temptation for surrender the forty prayed earnestly:
> “Help us, O God our Saviour, for here we stand in the water and our feet are stained with our blood; ease the burden of our oppression and tame the cruelty of the air; O Lord our God on Thee do we hope, let us not be ashamed, but let all understand that we who call upon Thee have been saved.”

God heard their prayer and provided warm light to melt the ice. Aglaius, the guard, seeing this divine manifestation, left his watch to join the remaining 39 in the freezing water, shouting ‘I am a Christian too.’ And he prayed: “Lord God, I believe in You, in Whom these soldiers believe. Add me to their number, and make me worthy to suffer with Your servants.” The soldiers welcome their new companion and they encourage each of other with these words:
> God so ordained that we made friends with each other in this temporary life; let us try not to separate even in eternity; just as we have been found plea sing to a mortal king, so let us strive to be worthy of the favor of the immortal King, Christ our God.” The soldiers miraculously survived the night.

## Martyrdom
The next morning Lucius come to check on the dead bodies. To his surprise not only did the 39 soldiers survived but his guard had joined them. Enrage at this sight, he urged the imprisonment and torture of the new forty. They suffered severe beatings. Their bones were broken, their legs crushed with sledge-hammers. They were pounded to their expiration. Until their last breath, they rested on God. And they sang: “Our help is in the name of the Lord.” With this unswerving attitude, death met them. Their voices were silenced and their body afterward burned, yet their testimony lived on.

### Here are the names of the 40 soldiers:
> Acacius, Aetius, Aglaius, Alexander, Angus, Athanasius, Candidus, Chudion, Claudius, Cyril, Cyrion, Dometian, Domnus, Ecdicius, Elias, Eunoicus, Eutyches, Eutychius, Flavius, Gaius, Gorgonius, Helianus, Herachus, Hesychius, John, Lysimachus, Meliton, Nicholas, Philoctemon, Priscus, Sacerdon, Severian, Sisinius, Smaragdus, Theodulus, Theophilus, Valens, Valerius, Vivianus, and Xanthias.

## Closing comment
Even in the midst of increased paganism in the Christian church of the fourth century,  faithful forty soldiers refused to sacrifice to idols. They kept their convictions until death. Not all are called to martyrdom; however, all of us need the courage to stand firm in times of trials. The Roman Emperor Julius Ceasar reminded us that “It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those who are willing to endure pain with patience.” We should ask ourselves how long will our patience last when enduring pain? By refusing idol worship, God gave the forty soldiers the “patience of the saints:…they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”
