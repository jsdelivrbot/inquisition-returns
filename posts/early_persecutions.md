![Early Persecutions's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/early_persecution.jpg)
## Persecution in the early church

The early church grew in wisdom, and in favor with God. Its members faced many challenges as they proceed with the proclamation of the Gospel. The influence of the Christian religion invoked the attention of both Jewish and Roman authorities. Many refuted the doctrines of the early church. Some believers settle for a compromised faith while others proclaimed the Gospel as the ultimate compass for Christendom. All the pioneers of the Christian Faith, save one, sealed their testimony at the cost of their lives. Here is their account.
* Peter, crucified upside down
* Paul, beheaded
* Jude, crucified
* Bartholemew, cruelly beaten then crucified
* Thomas, thrust with a spear
* Luke, hanged on a tree
* Stephen, stoned A.D 34
* James (John's brother), beheaded A.D. 44
* Philip, imprisoned, scourged, then crucified A.D. 54
* Matthew (the tax collector), hacked with a halberd
* James (Author of the book of James), beaten, stoned, dashed out brain
* Matthias (Apostle elected in Judah's stead), stoned, beheaded
* Andrew, crucified sideway (see: Andrew's Cross)
* Mark, mercilessly beaten to death
* John, the only disciple with a natural death

## The Tertullian approach
Tertullian (155 - 240 A.D), Christian apologist, made this stunning declaration:
> kill us, torture us, condemn us, grind us to dust; your injustice is the proof that we are innocent. Therefore God suffers that we thus suffer. When you recently condemned a Christian woman to the leno rather than to the leo, you made confession that a taint on our purity is considered among us something more terrible than any punishment and any death. Nor does your cruelty, however exquisite, avail you; it is rather a temptation to us. The oftener we are mown down by you, the more in number we grow; the blood of Christians is seed.

**We must then asked this question. Is the blood of believers (persecution) seed for the Church?**

The bible refrains from the characterisation of persecution as seeds for the Church. In every generation, many faithfully held to their scriptural convictions, and endured a brutal end in hope for a better resurrection. These believers willingly died because of their profound faith in God's word. They rarely prophesied on the impact of their martyrdom. 

Historically, the dying, rather undying, testimonies of many martyr help strengthens the church. In the presence of  persecution the church is refined, the believers commit themselves to the highest devotion to Christ. As the surrounding communities witness the faithfulness and determination of the martyrs, three exclusive response generally follow: *(1)* The intensification of persecution, *(2)* heartfelt conversion from previously undecided bystanders, *(3)* compromise of the gospel.

## Peace on earth?
There is an apparent discontinuity between the angels' announcement, following the birth of the Messiah, when compared to the trials of the early Christians. The prophet Isaiah prophesied, as confirm by the angels, that the coming Messiah would bring "Peace on earth." The Messiah, however, stipulates that he comes not as a peacemaker, but as one who bring a "sword." How come? How can those two coincidental ideas be reconciled?

The Gospel and the ministry of Jesus Christ bring hope to the human race. By his life, death, and resurrection, Christ guarantees the ultimate victory over Satan. He sets forth an exemplary life, if followed, would bring harmony to the each practicing soul--peace. At the same time, the Gospel carries a risk for calamity. Being an "offense" to its opposers, the Gospel establishes the highest standard of living for all. Its clarity exposed wicked deeds. Powerful authorities, lovers of darkness labor intensively to lessen the radiant rays of truths. By contentions, they persecute, imprisoned, discredit the contenders of the Gospel--a sword.

## Closing comments and question
The apostle Paul declared "all that will live godly in Christ shall suffer persecution." While refraining from arguing that all will suffer martyrdom, Paul firmly asserts that every believer will undergo trials and persecution. This statement forces us to ask many pending questions. 
* Will persecution ever comes to our lives?
* Do we make a difference for the kingdom of God, that warrants our persecution?
* Do we live in a stand out live in a manner that the "offense of the cross" is exhibited?
* Have we compromised the confined of Gospel in an attempt to render it attractive?
* Are we pressing the boots of the Gospel on the wicked toes of this world and leave a mark for repentance?
* Or have we manage to blend with the world and make the Gospel an irrelevant asset?
* (the list goes on)
