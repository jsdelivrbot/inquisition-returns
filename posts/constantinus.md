![Constantinus II - Decline of Rome's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/constantinus.jpg)
## Intro
Constantinus proved himself at a very young age. A devout leader, a skillful
soldier, and a professional archer, the young Caesar displayed his patriotic
ties to the Roman Empire. His loyalty was display in the front line. And
Constantinus sometimes flatter himself by claiming his absence would cause the
suffering of the empire.

## Early Years
*"If I die the Empire will suffer."* was the motto of the ever suspicious
ruler. History recorded his death at the age of 44 in year 361. Even the
emperor's life was shortened quickly, the decline of the empire lingers and
throttle for another 150 years. Following the death of Constantine and
Constantinus, Rome political influence deteriorated. The empire's downfall was
accelerated by the emergence of the Western barbaric tribes, so-called. Those
tribes wearied the Roman armies, yet they fell to overtake the Empire. Within
the next two centuries, the Political flowed into the emerging Universal Church.
The merge of ecclesiastical and political power beget the iron rule of the
dark ages.

## Religious Unity
Constantinus had one obsession, one goal, and one passion. He believed that
someone was planning to take his life. Endlessly terrified by the prospect of
losing his life, he managed to justify the execution of all the heirs to the
throne. Being childless, he narrowed the imperial line to two possible
successors: Gallus & Julian. After the death of his Father, Constantinus
insisted that the empire was his birthright, and for 13 years fought to
become the sole emperor. His passion and his ultimate desire were a united religious
Rome.

## Semi-Arian Settlement
To reach his goal of religious unity, Constantinus settled for some compromises.
During the first century, many theological teachings surfaced concerning the
nature of Christ. Some bishops argued in favor of the Nicene Creed while others
demanded the recognition of the Arian worldview. Constantinus tried to
resolve the issue by a bargain. He campaigned for a theological
doctrine that encompassed both view, known as a Semi-Arian approach.

## Clash & Persecution
Rome consisted of many religious bodies. Any attempt to legalize one religion
always causes trouble for another party. While the majority of the Christian
population applauded Constantinus for a season. His policies had lasting
negative consequences. Clergies that refused to access the Arian view was
persecuted as recorded in Foxes' book of martyrs.
> After the death of Constantine the Great, the Arians found means to
> ingratiate themselves into the favor of the emperor Constantinus, his son and
> successor in the east; and hence a persecution was raised against the
> orthodox bishops and clergy. The celebrated Athanasius, and other bishops,
> were banished, and their sees filled with Arians. 
>
> *Persecutions Under the Arian Heretics*

The execution extended to anyone who opposed the coveted unification of the
Emperor. Judaism was crushed and paganism marginalized. Constantinus tolerated
Christianity as first. In his later years, he tried to suppressed it. Not long
after, In 341, he criminalized sacrifices to idols. Five years later, pagan
temples were looted and destroyed. And the final blow followed in 356 when
Constantinus advocated for a death for a death decree. A penalty to rid the
country of Paganism.

## Conclusion
Compromise rarely resolve to lasting peace. When it comes to religious
convictions no one should be forced to join a movement without a clear doctrinal
conviction. History reminds of many cases when men tried to unify a territory
under one religious banner, either by force or by deception. It rarely works,
it never works. In matters concerning faith, the gospel, and salvation, all have
to decide individually what path to follow.

## Closing Questions
What are some developments have you seen lately toward the goal of establishing
a universal religion? Would such development succeed? If so, at what cost?
Would you personally give up your peculiarity to join such movement?
