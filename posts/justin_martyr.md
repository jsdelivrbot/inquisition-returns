![Justin Martyr's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/justin_martyr.jpg)
## Intro
Justin is a philosopher and Christian apologist. He was born in the first century around 100 A.D. in Flavia Neapolis, Italy. He studied Platonic and Stoic philosophy. A true philosopher, Justin devoted his life to radicalize the Christian faith. After his baptism, Justin traveled to Rome expounding on the Old Testament in many public squares.

While his writings contained true teachings, he sometimes misrepresented fundamental biblical teachings as he relied on his Platonic education. His teachings were profoundly philosophical. He dissected paganism from Christianity, denouncing the Roman gods a demonic representation of the "God of Moses." He wrote two apologies to showcase his beliefs. Justin is a man of zeal, yet it remains important to note that some of his teachings stand in contrast with other Apostolic figures such as those of Paul or Peter..

## Apologies and Works
Justin addressed a letter to Emperor Antonius, who was a devout persecutor of the Christians and  more severe and determined than Nero. In this letter to Antonius the First Apology, Justin insisted that the persecution of Christians is unjustified. He questioned the motif of the Emperor. From a philosophical standpoint, he argues for the incarnation and resurrection of Christ. Furthermore, Justin promotes Christians are civilized citizens whose rational beliefs surpasses the practices of the pagans. He denounced Antonius as a hypocrite for persecuting the Christians and neglecting the pagans.

In the first and second century many disregarded Christianity as a valid belief system. To the Roman, Christians were atheists because they worshiped an unseen God. Anyone who failed to openly sacrifice to idols was considered irreligious. To refrain from practicing the rituals of the Roman state was a crime because the state regulated religious matters. Justin argued, in his letter to the Emperor, that Christianity was a valid faith system that is based on stable, sound, and logical doctrines. At first, he entertained how both the physical idols of Rome and the unseen God of the Christians are both valid deities. And going further, he argued that idols were demonic figures.

## Doctrines
Justin had a profound understanding of the Old Testament and some the early writings. As a philosopher, he was convinced that Jesus was the "logos" from beginning, the "logos" that became flesh. Justin also preached, like other believers, that the Kingdom of God is a heavenly kingdom. One of the believes that distinguishes Justin from other scholars of the Alexandrian circle, was the notion of the mortality of the soul. He proclaimed that anyone who believes the soul is taken to heaven at death are not Christian.

Justin's theology resembles the teachings of the Alexandrians, Stoic and Platonic scholars, more than the teachings of the Christians at Antioch. He debated that the "God of the Moses" is the same as the "God of Plato." Justin would lecture on the concept of the eighth day. He tried to bring significance to the eighth day based upon the Mosaic practice of the circumcision. He would argue on the sacredness of the eighth day, that is Sunday, the day following the seventh day, on the fact that Jesus resurrected on that day. Justin also maintains that believers had holy convocations on Sunday because "God wrought a change in darkness and matter on the first day", referring to both Creation and Resurrection.

## Sabbatarian Conflict
Many Sabbatarian state: All Christians of the first and second century worshiped on the biblical Sabbath (Saturday), Justin's first apology refuted that notion. In the early days of Christianity, there two influential centers of doctrinal importance existed. These are Antioch and Alexandria. Many Alexandrian believers and scholars regarded Sunday as a holy day, long before Constantine did. The widespread celebration of the "Invincible Sun" and the "Venerable day of the Sun" as advertised by Emperors Aurelian and Constantine, respectively, erupted after Rome legally adopted and mingled Christianity with Paganism. Justin recorded that the Alexandrians overrode the sacredness of the Sabbath with their hybrid beliefs long before Constine came to power.

## Martyrdom
In 165 A.D., Justin was arrested and killed because of his teachings. When his life was threatened, he testified "if we are punished for the sake of our Lord Jesus-Christ, we hope to be saved." He earned his last name after his beheading, yielding his life for "true philosophy."

## Closing question
Even though Justin was a zealous defender of the faith, his messages were heavily influenced by the philosophy of his days. This led him to contradict many scriptural principles. What can we learn from him? Should we try to fuse the teachings and philosophies of men with God's word?
