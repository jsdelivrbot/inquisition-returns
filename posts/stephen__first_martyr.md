![Stephen - First Martyr's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/stephen_quote.jpg)
## Background

After Christ's resurrection, the disciples, and many believers received the promised of the Holy Spirit. The apostle boldly proclaimed the rising Messiah. By sign and wonder, the powerful words of Christ's witnesses moved many to repentance. The early church grew rapidly and continued steadfastly in the apostle's Doctrine. This growth poked at the establish authority of the sect of the Pharisee and, to some extent, altered the Roman Economy.

The message of the Gospel echoed in the midst of the Jews. The converted Jews consisted of the Hebrews and the Grecians. The Hebrews sheltered the legalistic Jews whose beliefs were dominated by their intensified admiration for the laws of Moses. The Grecians, as their name suggests, are Jews greatly influenced culturally and philosophically by Greek. The Hebrews viewed the Grecians as indulgent believers who failed to adhere to the tradition of the elders.

As these two groups continued to flourish, the responsibilities of the leaders of the church expanded. The Grecian, then, started to complain to the twelve petitioning that their brethren, mainly their widows, should partake in the daily patronage. The apostles, *the twelve*, acknowledged the neglect on the part of the Hebrews and asked of the Grecians to search out for seven notable men among themselves to fill the outlined void. Stephen, being a Grecian, was chosen to lead out in this effort.

## On Stephen
The book of Acts gives us very few information about Stephen. Chapter six introduced him as one of the seven chosen men. The characteristics of the chosen men as defined in the chapter gives some details upon which we can plant some intuitive speculations. The seven were of "Good report." From this, we can postulate that Stephen was an honest man whose life reflect the Savior he worshiped. By his reputation, he blamelessly gives a practical example that a believer can follow.

Stephen is also described as a man full of the Holy Spirit. His conversion consisted more of an outward appearance. The Holy Spirit shine in his ministry. Stephen depended on the manifestation and the power of the Holy Spirit. The text outlines that he was full of faith. Full, meaning that his emotions, thoughts, beliefs, actions, and plans were submitted to the will of God. It also inferable that Stephen has the highest spiritual character and devotion to Christ by simply being the first of the seven chosen men *(of more than 3000 members - cautious estimate)*.

Stephen, not an apostle, preached the unaltered Gospel to the Grecians. The signs and the miracles performed bare record of the power of Christ working through him. Stephen, not an elder or doctor of the law, voiced the plan of salvation with wisdom from above. The treats of the Pharisees failed to neutralize his influence. A deacon, a server of tables, a debater, Stephen spent the last few minutes of his life expounding on the scriptures. From Abraham to the prophets, he preached Jesus-Christ crucified, resurrected, and glorified. Even unto death, his character paralleled the Savior he vows to serve. He prayed God to hold his murderers guiltless. How Christ-like! How forgiving. He died a rigtheous death. Without committing any sin worthy of capital punishment, he was blamelessly executed as a falsified criminal.

## His Trial
The messages of Stephen caught the attention of the Sanhedrin. The members os the synagogue of the Libertines (emancipated captives of war), the Cyrenians and Alexandrians (possibly Jews from African descent), and others from Cicilia and parts of Asia all heard the powerful and wise exhortations of Stephen. The fruits of his labor evoked their intervention. They ineffectively contended with Stephen. His wisdom remain unresistible; the expression of his speech calls for repentance. Unable to scripturally reasoned with Stephen, the scribes, and the elders hire false witnesses to testify against him in hope to forge a legal case for his martyrdom.

## The Accusation
The members of Libertines revokes the "liberty" of a man preaching a message unpleasing to their ears. The proclamation of a risen Savior shattered their belief system. They refrain from confessing their envy to kill Stephen on this foundation alone. They resorted to their old practice by breaking the God's law, they lied, to withhold their traditions. They confess: "This man", that is Stephen, "would not cease from speaking blasphemous words against the temple." Stephen was portrayed as a destroyer who attempted to diminish the authority of Moses.

On the account of the risen Savior, Stephen did preach; however, no record was produced to prove and establish his guilt for the charge of blasphemy. Stephen, the accused, kept silent while the gaze of the council expected a defense from him. He remained calm. And instantly, God worked a miracle. The one who was tried for speaking contrary to the custom of Moses was transfigured. His face radiated, shined, glowed  as if it has been the face of and angel. Stephen was glorified, and his countenance reflected a scene not seen since the days of Moses.

## Stephen's Judgment
The high priest, with little interest in justice and with a dim disposition to spare Stephen's life, ask him according to the law to the respond to the accusations. Hoping maybe to find a reason to punish him, contrary to the law, the high priest curiously throw this snare: "Are these things so?". Are they? Stephen?...

Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, unwilling to defend himself, filibustered the Sanhedrin floor. And opening his mouth he summarize the story of redemption starting from Abraham. He declared: 

> Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
> And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.
> Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
> And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
> And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.
> And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
> And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.
>
> And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
> And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
> Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
> But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
> And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
> Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
> So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
> And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.
>
> But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
> Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
> The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.
> In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:
> And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
> And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
>
> And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
> And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:
> For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
> And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
> But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
> Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?
> Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
>
> And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
> When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,
> Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.
> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
> This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.
> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
>
>This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.
> This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:
> To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
> Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
> And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
> Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?
> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
> Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
>
> Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
> Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
> But Solomon built him an house.
> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
> Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?
>
> Hath not my hand made all these things?
> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.
> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:
> Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.

## His Martyrdom
Stephen debated legal scholars, the brightest of the Pharisee. The council filtered his sound doctrine. Facing the reality of their sins, they diverge from the road of repentance. Anger clouded their hearts, their throats thirst for innocent blood, the teeth gnashed waiting as to devour guiltless flesh. And Stephen, perceiving their envy, kept his eyes on the author and finisher of the faith looking into heaven beheld the glory of the magnificent God. And he testified saying: 

> Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.

That will do, murmured the scribes, elders, and the people. Blocking their ears from the receptive truth. They ran, grab Stephen, drag him, and cast him out of the city. And there the first stones were cast. Stephen prayed "Lord, Jesus receive my Spirit." Looking heavenward, he loudly pleaded to God to forgive his accusers. And, yes, even them who unfairly buried him with stones. 

## The spreading of the Gospel
From the death of Christ to the stoning of Stephen, the Gospel was only proclaimed among the Jews. Peter labored near the porch of Jerusalem, calling to repentance the Jews who somehow have already heard of the Messiah. Stephen extended the range by promulgating the Gospel to the outcast Jews, the Alexandrian, the Cyrenians, the Grecians, and so forth. At his stoning, the countdown of the Sanhedrin's patience expired. The Sanhedrin started open persecution with the intent to deracinate the teaching of the risen Savior. The believers scattered. And this scattering caused the diffusion of the Gospel everywhere.

In stoning Stephen, the Pharisee thought to set forth an example for anyone who continued in the apostles' doctrines. This scare tactic failed to work. Stephen served as a conduit between the Jews and Gentiles. Starting with Philip, his compatriot in the faith, and continuing with Paul, defender of the Pharisee how opposed him during his trial, God enabled the winds of Salvation to bring the raft of the Gentiles to the coast of His saving grace. Stephen's death catalyzed the proclamation of the Gospel. The early church increased. If the Gospel consisted of a spark, instead of quenching its flames, the Sanhedrin by stoning Stephen ignited a fire. As the early believers escaped to flee persecution and protect their lives, their dashing flight amplifies the brightness of the redemptive torch they cling.

## Closing thoughts
The Grecians complained to the apostle and asked them to take charge of the neglect and the shortcoming of the Hebrews. The apostle suggested that they find seven notable men for the task. They (the complainers) found seven men, among themselves, to fulfill the ministration. Like the Grecians, how often are we the prayerful answer to the shortcomings that we notice around us?
