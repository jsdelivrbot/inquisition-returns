![Isms in the Early Roman Church's Quote](https://servone.wspecs.com/wspecs/full/isms_century.jpg)
## Intro
State and church officially clasped hands in the fourth century. Around this time, many controversies arose within the church. Church officials started to rely on the government. Church matters were controlled by the Roman state. Within the church, some believers decided to follow the hierarchical structure established by the sovereign Holy Roman Empire. A group of believers heavily relied on the findings of the early church council, while others searched the canon to calibrate their beliefs and to define their faith.

Around the time of the Council of Nicea, many opposing ideologies arose. Believers disagreed on many issues including the nature of Christ and His role, the mission of the church, the veneration of saints, the role of the state, and others. The gospel was marred of its purity. Instead of clinging onto the bible as the compass for the Christian movement, many believers reduced the Gospel to human tradition. Some of the conflicting views included: Arianism, Asceticism, Donatism, Eutychianism, Monarchianism, Nestorianism, Pelagianism, Platonism, Sabellianism. Let us take a look at those isms.

## Arianism
As the doctrine of the trinity was being formulated many Christians confronted such views on the bases on scripture. The renounce a subscription to a philosophical image of the Godhead as presented by the trinity. Arian refuted any views that declared the Holy Spirit as a divine being. History also reports that Arianist denied the divinity and sonship of Jesus. As far as we know, the truth regarding regarding Arianism has been buried and destroyed. The Arians tribes were annihilated by the supporters of the Trinitarian view.

## Asceticism
An ascetic Christian is a strict follower of laws and regulations. Asceticism relied on stern discipline and rule to avoid indulgence. While this viewpoint presented a promising facade, the underlying principle here is mainly salvation by works. Such viewpoint advocates penitence and self-infliction. Instead of rejoicing in the Lord, ascetic Christians introduced a yoke of bondage. This yoke made the Gospel appear gloomy and despairing. Rejection of the pleasures of the world is biblical, yet such reform should lead to spiritual rejuvenation and not bodily mortification as advocated by asceticism.

## Donatism
This theological teaching, led by Donatus, questions the sanctity of a corrupted hierarchical order in the church. In the early church of the first local churches simply anointed bishops as pastors. As the church centralized its power, corruption set in. Many of the leaders failed to adhere to the sacred council. The system of the priesthood established in the fourth century no longer consisted of honest men, with the highest devotion to Christ. Donatus confronted them and declared them ineligible to perform the sacraments of the church. While the bible advocates that a bishop should be blameless, the bible also points to Jesus as the author and finisher of our faith. In Donatism sanctification of an act was tightly coupled to the clergy who performed it.

## Eutychianism
Eutyches (c. 378-454) argues that Christ is a mixture of the divine and human. This view assumed that Christ had a divine to help him during his earthly mission. This is problematic because such view removes the Messiahship from Christ. Eutyches bypass the fallen nature of Christ, making him a robotic creature, who acted as our saving sacrifice by creating a new nature for Christ. This theology makes it impossible for Christ to be our living example. The bible is clear that God is the Alpha and Omega; however, when Jesus came to this earth he became Emmanuel, God with us. He took our fallen disposition, and became fully susceptible to the woes of sins, even though he was and is God. This divine risk is overlooked by Eutychiasnim.

## Monarchianism
Monarchianists are rigorous monotheists that believe that God is one; a son is not part of the Godhead. In this teaching, Christ is portrayed as a mere man. In the progressive view of Monarchism, some will admit that the human Christ is adopted by God. And that God has given him danymis. That is power. Monarchianists diverge from the theology of a Godhead, which consists of the three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They will simply admit that God is one, and God is a spirit. Scripture tells us that God is one. The oneness of God is descriptive of the oneness define in the union of a husband and his wife. The two (husband and wife) will become one flesh.

## Nestorianism
Nestorius (c.386-451) claimed that Jesus existed as two persons: the human and the divine Christ. This view differs from Eutychianism in essence; however, they arrive at the same conclusion. Nestorius postulates that Christ the human, as the perfect man, died on the cross for our sin. Christ the divine did not suffer on the cross. Christ, according to the prophet Isaiah, bore the iniquity of us all. Though he knew no sin, he was sacrificed for our transgression. The only way that Christ could be our ultimate sacrifice and example is by his righteous life as a human. And the only way that Jesus bore the sins of the whole world is by his divinity. The beauty of the Gospel embodied in the realization that God is not only demanding the worship of his creature, He willingly came down to face the ultimate penalty of sin. Nestorianism destroyed this revelation by making Jesus a substitute not only for man but for God.

## Pelagianism
Pelagianists conjectured that humans are by default good creatures and that they are unaffected by the sin of Adam. Given this conjecture, this view claimed that man can pave his way to God without a mediator. It is biblically accurate that each individual is responsible for their own sins. According to the bible, no one inherits sin. The consequences of our parent’s choices affect us environmentally and biologically. As humans we are all subjected the consequences of sins, mainly sickness, and death. Even though we individually sin by choice, Christ remains the only way to salvation because without his sacrifice humanity would be unreconciled to God. The dark influences of this present age are enticing. Only in Christ can we have the assurance of salvation and certainty on overcoming sin.

## Platonism
Platonism are philosophical ideas that are derived from Plato. In the platonism view, an abstract object is an object that does not exist in space or time and which is therefore entirely non-physical and non-mental. While platonic philosophical reasoning is skillful, poetic, and coherent, it is subject to the authority of the bible. Many great philosophers defended their faith in the early centuries; however, some of their beliefs varied from the writing of the Moses and prophets. Even though it is brilliant to meet logic with logic, science with science, philosophy with philosophy, it wiser to meet all reasoning with a ’thus saith the Lord’

## Sabellianism
Sabellianism maintains that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are different aspects of the same God. It states: There is no substantial difference between the Father, Son, and Spirit. According to Sabellius, all those names refer to the same and one person using different names. These three in one or three out of one is unbiblical because the plurality of God can be seen even at creation when God said, let us make man in our image. To say that Father, Son, and Spirit are one person would be to diagnose God with a tripolar disorder.

## Closing comments
All isms in the fourth century attempted to destroy the relevance of Christ in some way or another. Attacks amplified over time. Attempts were made to diminish the divinity and humanity of Christ. Even in Christian circles, many failed to see Christ as our example as overcomer of sin. In many worldviews Christ is deconstructed from being the way to Salvation. Instead of being our way, many view him as a mere teacher or a mere prophet. These opposing views were created at a raging rivalry in the early church. Many sectarian persecutions occurred. These persecutions started with the Arians.

The bible beholds Christ in a higher light. I wonder why there are so many isms and philosophies in existence, when scripture plainly revealed the character of Christ. In Matthew, Jesus is the Messiah. In Mark, Jesus is the Carpenter. In Luke, Jesus is the Son of Man. In John, He is presented as the Son of God. He can sympathize with our feelings because he was tempted like we are, tempted in all points. Though he had a fallen nature, he overcame sin in the flesh to be our example in overcoming sin. Jesus, the word from the beginning, became one of us. Jesus, the Alpha (the beginning, that is un-borrowed life), became sin for us. It wasn’t theatrics. He took the divine risk by walking among us vulnerable to sin. He was crucified, he rose, ascended. Now he is ministering as our high priest in the heavenly sanctuary. And he will come as the conquering king to this earth!
