## Intro
Throughout the ages, the inhabitants of the world worshiped the sun. In one
form or another, deities were created to represent the sun. Numerous creative form
of nature worship has existed in almost all civilizations. Some create a god
out of everything; however, the sun has received an undeserved homage and
reverence that is only due to the Creator God. Instead of worshiping the
Creator, mankind worshiped the created. Many prominent civilizations deified
the sun in the following manners.
* Egypt (Ra and Osiris)
* Phoenicia and Canaan (Baal, Melkarth, Shamas, Adoni, Moloch)
* Syria (Tammuz and Elagabalus)
* Moabites (Baal-peor and Chemosh)
* Babylonians and Assyrians (Bel and Shamas)
* Medes and Persians (Ormuz and Mithra)
* Indians (Mitra, Mithra, or Mithras)
* Greece (Adonis, Apollo, Bacchus, and Hercules)
* Phrygia (Atys)
* Rome (Bacchus, Apollo, and Hercules)

## Early Adoption in Rome
Sun worship is a trademark of the Egyptians. Artifacts from their
civilization show how they honored their god Ra. Many other empires followed
Egypt in worshiping the sun. Rome was not immune to such practice. The Romans
have adopted many practices from the Babylonians, including sun worship. During the
third and fourth century, however, Rome's religious practices was diverse.

Aurelian, Roman emperor 270-275, reunited Rome during his reign. He claimed
the title *Restitutor Orbis*--restorer of the world. Aurelian introduced
a religious reform. He praised the sun as a god, under the name *Sol Invictus*,
the Invincible or Unconquerable sun. He wanted to establish a monotheistic
religion that derived its power in a single god, the sun. The empire adopted
the motto: "one faith, one empire." In 274, temples were erected, new cults
were established, and other gods were banished. The sun reigned supreme and all
other religions were outlawed. 

Aurelian's successors adopted the new god. Diocletian vehemently persecuted the
Christian who would not sacrifice to the Roman gods. Constantine, a devout sun
worshiper, covenanted to the Christian faith. His confession allowed his to
introduce paganism into Christianity. Like the bishops of Roman, he secretly
promotes sun worship by re-branding pagan ideologies as sacred. The religious
diversity in Rome no longer existed. All were forced to adopted the newly
blended form of pagan-christianity.

## The Venerable day of the Sun
According to the *Edict of Milan*, all citizens were free to worship according to
their conscience. This law lasted for only a few years. On March 7, 321,
Constantine decreed
> On the Venerable Day of the Sun [venerabili die Solis--the sacred day of
> the Sun] let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all
> workshops be closed. In the country, however, persons engaged in agriculture
> may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits; because it often happens
> that another day is not so suitable for grain-sowing or for vine-planting;
> lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations the bounty of heaven
> should be lost--Given the 7th day of March, [A.D. 321], Crispus and
> Constantine being consuls each of them for the second time.
>
> *The First Sunday Law of Constantine 1, in Codex Justinianus,
> lib. 3, tit. 12, 3; trans. in
> Phillip Schaff History of the Christian Church," Vol. 3, p. 380.*

All meant all. The people were required to rest, according to the emperor's
decree. Only the farmers living in agricultural areas were exempts. What
reasons were given for the decree? No substantial reason, except that
Constantine declared the first day of week sacred, the sacred day of
the sun. Even today, in English, the first day of the week is call Sunday.

## Lords' day
Many Christian churches even today follow the example of Constantine.
They worship on Sunday as prescribe by Constantine. Some would even venture to
proclaim Sunday as the Lord's day. We have to frankly and sincerely demand
the scriptural bases for such assertion. Is Sunday the Lord's day? How? By no
means. For the bible clearly teaches that Jesus is the *Lord of the Sabbath*
-Mark 2:28. History, Jewish records, and even modern calendars remind us that
the Sabbath which is the seventh day of the week is Saturday.

> It is a matter of wonderment to us to see Catholic clergymen using the word
> ' Sabbath ' for ' Sunday. ' We protest energetically against the Protestant
> mode of speech. It does not look well for Catholics to knuckle to such
> Protestant fantastic notions. Sunday is founded, not on Scripture, but on
> tradition, and is distinctly a Catholic institution. As there is no Scripture
> for the transfer of the day of rest from the last to the first day of the week,
> Protestants ought to keep their Sabbath on Saturday, and thus leave Catholics
> in full possession of Sunday.
>
> *Catholic Record, Sept. 17, 1891.*

## Closing Comment
Why then does many worship on Sunday providing that such practice is
unscriptural? It probably have to do with tradition, or maybe ignorance.
If someone would like to make a biblical case for Sunday sacredness, I would
love to hear it. In the meantime, allow me to share with you the fourth
commandment.
> Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and
> do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in
> it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
> manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is
> within thy gates: For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,
> and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord
> blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
