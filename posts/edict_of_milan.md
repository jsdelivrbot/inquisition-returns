![Edict of Milan's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/edict_of_milan.jpg)
## Intro
Shortly after Constantine gained control of Western Rome. He started to find ways to establish his dominance in the Roman empire. In 312 at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, He defeated Maxentius and gained much of control of Rome. He confessed to his general his vision of ‘chi-rho’ sign. A symbol that spells the name of Christ. And Constantine claimed that he has been shown that he shall conquer Rome in the ‘chi-rho’ sign. Upon his victory, he refused to attend homage services at the Jupiter temple. And verbally align himself under the Christian banner.

## Origin
A year later Constantine settled a treaty with Licinius, the rival emperor of eastern Rome. Both agreed that ‘all should be able to worship the gods with a free conscience.’ This assertion involved people of all faith, including the Christian. In February 313, Constantine published the decree in western Rome and Licinius followed a few month later in June of the same year. The agreement to cease the persecution based on religious practices is known as the ‘Edict of Milan’.

## Promises
This dictum guaranteed religious toleration for Christianity and believers of other faith throughout Rome. After 10 years of severe trials (303 - 313), Christians were legally allowed to worship God as they pleased. This legal measure allowed any to organize churches and assemble whenever possible. Others legal attempts have been made to ease persecution. The Edict of Milan was the first successful one.

## Diplomatic Ties
There exists, of course, a few diplomatic ties to the edict. Wars and persecutions ravaged the Roman economy. The edict was enacted to promulgate the welfare of the state. Everyone was encouraged to pray for their safety, and for that of the republic. Once the persecutions under Diocletian failed, to settle to imperial struggles Rome granted religious tolerance to its citizen. The edict went a step further, by restoring to the Christian as much as possible the confiscated properties from previous persecution. 

## Favoritism
The Edict of Milan enabled Constantine to control and regulate church affairs. During his reign, Constantine decreed many laws that greatly favored the Christians. Milan marks the end of Christian persecution. In 313, the State vows to abandon such policies. After 313, previously murdered defenders of the faith were publicly honored. Many pay homage the tomb of the martyrs. After the distortion of the nature of Christ in the following years, many of those martyrs became canonized.

## Decline and Outcome
The party failed to last. The promise of religious freedom vanished in less than a decade. In 324 after Constantine gained control of the whole empire, Church authority mingle with civil officers to enforce orthodoxy. Starting with the marketed observance of the ‘venerable day of the sun’, many were compel into accepting paganism into the church. While the age of martyrdom faded, the transition to the ‘Christian Empire’ began. The ‘Holy Roman Empire’ would pick up the baton where Imperial Rome left off. And very soon after, with the engulfing of state power, the Christian Church-State coerced worship.

Transcript
Here is the Transcript of the Edict.

### The "Edict of Milan " (313 A. D.)
> When I, Constantine Augustus, as well as I Licinius Augustus d fortunately met near Mediolanurn (Milan), and were considering everything that pertained to the public welfare and security, we thought -, among other things which we saw would be for the good of many, those regulations pertaining to the reverence of the Divinity ought certainly to be made first, so that we might grant to the Christians and others full authority to observe that religion which each preferred; whence any Divinity whatsoever in the seat of the heavens may be propitious and kindly disposed to us and all who are placed under our rule And thus by this wholesome counsel and most upright provision we thought to arrange that no one whatsoever should be denied the opportunity to give his heart to the observance of the Christian religion, of that religion which he should think best for himself, so that the Supreme Deity, to whose worship we freely yield our hearts) may show in all things His usual favor and benevolence. Therefore, your Worship should know that it has pleased us to remove all conditions whatsoever, which were in the rescripts formerly given to you officially, concerning the Christians and now any one of these who wishes to observe Christian religion may do so freely and openly, without molestation. We thought it fit to commend these things most fully to your care that you may know that we have given to those Christians free and unrestricted opportunity of religious worship. When you see that this has been granted to them by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship for the sake of the peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases ; this regulation is made we that we may not seem to detract from any dignity or any religion.
>
> Moreover, in the case of the Christians especially we esteemed it best to order that if it happens anyone heretofore has bought from our treasury from anyone whatsoever, those places where they were previously accustomed to assemble, concerning which a certain decree had been made and a letter sent to you officially, the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception, Those, moreover, who have obtained the same by gift, are likewise to return them at once to the Christians. Besides, both those who have purchased and those who have secured them by gift, are to appeal to the vicar if they seek any recompense from our bounty, that they may be cared for through our clemency,. All this property ought to be delivered at once to the community of the Christians through your intercession, and without delay. And since these Christians are known to have possessed not only those places in which they were accustomed to assemble, but also other property, namely the churches, belonging to them as a corporation and not as individuals, all these things which we have included under the above law, you will order to be restored, without any hesitation or controversy at all, to these Christians, that is to say to the corporations and their conventicles: providing, of course, that the above arrangements be followed so that those who return the same without payment, as we have said, may hope for an indemnity from our bounty. In all these circumstances you ought to tender your most efficacious intervention to the community of the Christians, that our command may be carried into effect as quickly as possible, whereby, moreover, through our clemency, public order may be secured. Let this be done so that, as we have said above, Divine favor towards us, which, under the most important circumstances we have already experienced, may, for all time, preserve and prosper our successes together with the good of the state. Moreover, in order that the statement of this decree of our good will may come to the notice of all, this rescript, published by your decree, shall be announced everywhere and brought to the knowledge of all, so that the decree of this, our benevolence, cannot be concealed.

## Closing comment
The ‘Edict of Milan’ survived for nine years. Its promises failed to prevail in the following centuries. By the time Europe was fully indoctrinated by Romish dogmas. The principle of ‘cuius regio eius religio’  survived. The religion of the prince really did become the religion of the populace. Any forcible church-state union guarantees such outcome.
