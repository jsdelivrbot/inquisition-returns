## Background

Around 15 years after the death of Stephen, the Gospel reached the realm of Roman Empire. The event that started in front of the Temple of Jerusalem spread to Judea, Samaria, and beyond. The convincing and convicted truths of the Gospel added drew many repentant sinners to God's fold.

The Gentiles, non-Jewish believers, shaped their worldview and experience around their newly discovered beliefs. For many Gentiles, choosing to live for Christ came with the cost of losing earthly ties both friends and family. Some lost their livelihood. They were ridiculed for traded the practice of their previous religion (from Greek religio, which often implies open sacrifice to gods and idols) for the worship of an unseen God. Being planted in their new life, they overcame mockery and scoffing as they fellowshipped with other believers.

As the church continues to expand, there arise teachers preaching another Gospel, commanding circumcision as a requirement for the Salvation. For they esteemed that without the laws of Moses, Gentiles forfeited Salvation altogether. Paul, formerly Saul, a preacher of Justification by faith opposed their false teaching, and openly declared to the supporter of circumcision their errors. He argues that anyone who preaches another gospel, a message where the sufficiency of Jesus's sacrifice is diminished, is "accursed." Paul maintains that the Gospel offers liberty. Compelling others to follow the letter of this Mosaic Law, according to Paul, introduced bondage instead of liberty.

The ministry of Paul was tailored to the Gentiles while the ministry of Peter centered around the Jews. In a vision, Peter was invited to share the Gospel with Cornelius, a Roman centurion. From that experience, Peter judged that God has also opened the path of Salvation to the Gentiles. With this firm conviction, he endorsed Paul's ministry and effort to bring the Gospel to the Gentiles.

## Antioch's Incident
At Antioch, an incident preceded the calling for the Council of Jerusalem. Peter fellowshipped and dined with Gentiles believers. When messengers from James came to Antioch, Peter withdrew himself from the Gentiles, hoping to dissuade any quarrels resulting from his association with the "uncircumcised" believers. Paul, seeing the hypocrite behavior, openly confronted Peter and showed him his failure to live the Standard of the Gospel. In his confrontation with Peter, Paul scripturally proves how the sacrifice of Christ is the only mean to Salvation. Peter, the one who claimed that "it is better to obey God than man," failed to live out his conviction hoping escaped the human judgement and criticism. 

## The Council
Jews from Judea and some believers of the Pharisees continued to impose circumcision on the Gentiles, Paul and Barnabas opposed them. And they agreed to go to Jerusalem to settle the issue at hand. Add arriving there, they disputed and offered their supported arguments for or against the prose.

After listening to their discourse, Peter and James disclose their conviction on the matter. Peter shared his testimony and James offered a scriptural stance for his resolution.

### Peter's response
> Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.

### James's response
> Men and brethren, hearken unto me: Simon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:

And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.  
>
> Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

### Resolution
The apostles, the elders, and the whole church agreed with the testimony of Peter and the scriptural affirmation of James. After hearing the wonders and the miracles of God among the Gentiles, they consented, on based on the given evidence, that fleshly circumcision failed to enhance the Christian experience. The council wrote a letter to the Christian in Antioch, and it reads:

> The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:
>
> Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment: It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
>
> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well.
>
> Fare ye well.

### Closing comments
The Council of Jerusalem deals with an important decision for the early church. Both the Jews of the circumcision and Paul was convicted in their respective beliefs. Their conviction was affirmed or refuted by scripture as highlighted in the answer of Apostle James. Requirements imposed by humans are the primary reason for unnecessary religious contentions. In matters concerning Faith, Salvation, and the Gospel, what steps do we take to ensure that scripture affirmed our convictions?
