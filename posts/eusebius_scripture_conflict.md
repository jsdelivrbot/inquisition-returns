![Eusebius: Scripture Conflict's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/eusebius.jpg)
#Intro
The first three centuries of Christianity was marked by persecution. From its
inception, Christians were challenged at all levels of society. The rich and poor, the
scholar and unlearned, the statesmen and the servant, all were called to 
behold Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for sin and the redeemer of the world.
This message provided hope to Jews and Gentiles, to philosophers and skeptics.
The call to repentance closely associated with the Gospel attacked the Roman
religion. Followers and believers of Christ were imprisoned, ridiculed,
beaten, and killed until the Edict of Milan.

# Rise of Compromise
The greatest attacked on the Christian faith was not the persecution under Nero.
Diocletian even in his devout attempt failed to extinguish the Gospel's flame.
It was compromise that undermined the Gospel and apostasy that threaten its
power. Thanks to the famous Constantine, the church ventured on the path of 
destruction by mingling the religious with the profane. And the leaders of the
church, just like the Pharisees, managed to impede and trample God's word.
In the fourth century, one called Eusebius, lead a fight that impacted future
generations. By his cleverness and reputation, he molded the Gospel and
fabricated scriptures to facilitate the expansion of universal apostasies.

# Contributions
Eusebius was born in 263 AD. During his lifetime, he was able to witness both
the traumatic experience Christians and the political rise of Christianity.
Eusebius is known for his contributions to church history. Through his writing,
he exposed the ill treatment of the Christians under Diocletian. He also
wrote papers and letters on important ecclesiastical events including the
Council of Nicea in 325.

# Friend of the emperor
As a fourth century writer, Eusebius penned historical accounts that favored
Constantine. By his flattery, he managed to thrive during the reign of the
emperor. He praised Constantine and declared him as the leader of the rising
Catholic religion. Eusebius considered himself as the spiritual advisor of
Constantine. He viewed the emperor as the champion of religion and was
willing to do whatever it takes to forward Constantine's goals.

# Criticism
The documents lefts by Eusebius are criticized for their lack of depth. As a
historian, Eusebius show favoritism in his writings. He only used sources that
supported his views. And in many cases, he would make careless and
avoidable mistakes by referencing to unreliable sources. This approach 
devitalized his credibility and painted a biased picture for his targeted
audience.

# Attitude towards Rome
Eusebius share a popular sentiment of many church leaders in the fourth 
century. With the popularity of Christianity, many departed from the 
Gospel as preach by the apostles, to a refined message that pleased both
Church and State. Eusebius publicly agreed that State should govern the
affairs of the church. He twisted the teachings of Paul and created church
positions that are unknowns to the apostolic Church.

His spiritual and scriptural errors are highlighted in his teachings concerning
Christ. Like the other bishops at the Council of Nicea, he proposed a
scriptural thesis for the Godhead, and proceeded to preach a different
Christ. In his doctrinal understanding, he undermined the mission of Christ.
He forsook what scripture revealed to adopt a platonic understand
of God.

# Actions to demote Christ
Eusebius's motif become clearer as he aligned himself with Rome. As the friend
and eulogist of Constantine, Eusebius did him a great favor. He reduced the
authority of Christ to appeased the emperor. He managed to find a match
between the nature of Christ and that of the emperor. As a bishop of
Caesarea, instead of leading people to Christ, he turned the attention
of his followers to Constantine.

To achieve his misguided goal of uniting church and state, Constantine
requested for a total revamp of the Christian faith. Eusebius was glad
to help in this matter. Eusebius used his influence to rewrite words of the
bible to match Rome's interest. He forged 50 copies of scripture, full
of apostasy and ship them to eastern Rome. The early Christians
rejected his copies and relied on the received text from the apostles.

Eusebius turn religion into a profitable affair. He created benefits for
himself and the emperor. He deliberately departed from the 
simplicity of the gospel, to gain the riches of this world. For temporal
glory, he willingly trampled God's word. Even though he recorded
many events in the first 300 years of Christianity, very few Christians
accepted his doctrinal findings. Eusebius died around 340, yet his erroneous
teachings lived on. 

# Closing comments.
The greatest war ever waged against Christianity is a scriptural warfare. In
the early days of the faith, we find Eusebius boldly rewording the teachings
of the apostles to match his preconceived ideas. Later in history,
the Roman Catholic Church claims all right to interpret scripture.
In our own time, we see countless bible version attempting to replace
the received text *(Textus receptus)*

Scripture clearly warns against reviewing the word of the Torah, the
Prophets, and the apostles. Any surgical procedure to remove or to add to
the bible is contrary to God's will. The battle against scripture is at his
peak. With the discovery of the so-called codex *Sinaiticus* and *Vaticanus*,
we now have bibles in the same language with more than 12,000 differences.
I will appeal that we hold firm to the *textus receptus*
