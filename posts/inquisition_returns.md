![Inquisition Returns's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/ir-preview.jpg)
## Intro
Inquisition is defined intensive questioning and investigation often under force or torture. Force and torture during the questioning are often associated with the historical inquisitions started by Holy Roman Empire. Many individuals tend to believe that the inquisitions were *"not that bad."*, even among Christians. This naive assumption is fully refuted by historical account in form of writings and pictures that cover the horrible events that occurred during the dark ages.

We should learn from history. Really. As we read about the inquisition, it should become evident that its main goal was to keep everyone, without exception, in darkness -- by fighting vehemently against heresy. To formulate any ideas whether scientific, religious, philosophical, or even political without the approbation of the Church of Rome meant danger. All subjects were streamlined to the dogmas of the time. And anyone that failed to corporate with the state, trying to think for themselves, needed approval. If no approval had been gained and their ideas stood in conflict to the dogmas of the time, individuals were forced to publicly recant their ideas, like Galileo Galilei. If individuals did not consent to recant their *"faulty"* ideas alternatives consisted of torture and in many cases as result death.

## Overview
The barbarity that takes place during the inquisitions is never fully expressible in human terms. While many apologists may try to undermine its horrific traces, history begs to differ. The inquisition thrives on a many unchallenged-philosophy. The first mainly consist on unquestioned obedience to state authority (heavily influenced by Rome). The second pillar was false accusations followed by unfair trials. The third was the loose belief that inquisition was a sacred cause imposed by God through the Roman Catholic Church.

Many questions are still asked today vis-à-vis of the inquisition. How many people were burnt at the stake? Who was responsible for the inquisition? What does it mean to be a Heretic? Was the inquisition that "bad"? How long did it last? And the list goes on. It is hard to answer those questions with exact numbers. Many inquisitors fully documented their pursuits of heretics to their superior; however, most of those documents are safely guarded. Only very few have access to them. Many prudent estimates argue that inquisitions account for more than 70 million deaths over a period of 600 years; the true numbers might be far from these estimates, who knows?

### On confession and recantation
Many individual lived in severe fear during the dark ages. Some will adopt imposed doctrines to avoid unwanted punishment. Others stick to their guts. When an influential person joins the rank of the heretics, they were encouraged to recant. This, of course, was more than a public confession. Many times, recanters were asked to sign papers. And against their will, those papers served as a testament that facilitates the public relation role of their inquisitors.

An inquisitor's job consists of finding heretics and straightening them out – aligning them with the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. The process they follow was inconsistent with any moral law imaginable. All that what was needed was an accusation. An accusation equated guilt. A "guilty" person will faced corporal punishment. Other inquisitors focused on carrying their "sacred calling" by leading armies to cities that they devastated by their vandalistic ventures sparing neither children, nor women, nor men.

### On Torture
The techniques of torture for inquisition have been perfected during the time of the dark ages. To many heretics, a quick beheading would pass as a blessing from above. While this blog will mainly focus on the events surrounding the inquisitions, you are encouraged to read up on some of the tools that were used for torture on your own. It's fair to note that torture was mostly used on women on the accusation of practicing witchcraft, also on American soil, see the Witchcraft trials of Salem, Massachusetts. The punishment that a witch had to suffer was, in nicer terms, demoralizing.

### On the inquisition's sacredness
There is nothing sacred or "holy" about the inquisition. The horrific acts carried out fail, in all their details, to reveal the divine purpose of this investigative cause. Moved by greed, many used the cloak of God's approval in swaying zealous destroyers in perverting God's creation. Often it was an use as an act of retaliation.

### Returns?
In retrospect, it remains a pléonasme to argue that the inquisition will return. The tools of torture the inquisition never went away (not that they are needed, torture is now digitized yet who knows), the motif still exist. The dormant and missing attributes are the venue and the power to reestablish such practice. It wasn't until 1908 that the “Congregation of Inquisition” was abolished and renamed into “Holy Office”. And the "Holy Office", in 1960, become the "Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith" led formost by Cardinal Josef Ratzinger at the time, who became Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.

### Definition
The term inquisition refers to many things. Most people tend to associate it mostly with the Spanish inquisition and the medieval inquisition. In this blog, inquisition will be defined as:

> A period of intensive investigation in an attempt to establish the supremacy of the Church of Rome through confession, recantation, and torture. Its large-scale implementation started from the 12th Century and ending at the dusk of the 18th century.

## Goal
(IR) Inquisition returns' focus surpasses the plain recitation of what history reveals. Its goal is simply to make comparisons between the past and present, and highlight many similarities between the build-up of the inquisitive era with ours. Often times, we look at the past, as a non-applicable distant memory; yet, over and over again history has repeated itself. By sankofa in more than 2000 years of history, IR aspires to show how this generation is susceptible to an inquisitive-like future.

## Closing question
Maybe you are an inquisition expert, chances are you aren't. That's far from expected. The sad reality remains that many are clueless on what the inquisition entails. Let's ponder on this question: How did 600+ years of history escape from our radars?
