![Nero's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/nero.jpg)
## Rise to the throne
Nero is the last of the Julio-Claudian Emperor. His mother Agrippina was the great grand-daughter of Augustus. Caligula, a Roman Emperor, exiled Agrippina and her family. After, Caligula's death, Aggripina regained access to the royal halls. She later married Claudius, the Roman Emperor at the time, and persuaded him to declare Nero as his adoptive son, making him heir to the throne. With this adoption, Aggripina hopes to secure access to the Roman throne. She poisoned Claudius, and Nero became the emperor or Rome at the age of 17 in 54 A.D.

## Plots
Aggripina totally controlled the empire in the early years of Nero's reign. As Nero become older, he refused to follow the orders of his mother. Aggripana started to threaten Nero and right to the throne. To solve this problem, Nero poisoned his younger brother, heir to the throne, to signal his mother of his intention to secure the throne.

## Early Years
During the first five years of his reign, Nero earned the confidence of the Roman citizens. He lowered taxes. He even took some liberal actions by granting the right to complain to the Roman slaves. He supported the arts, theatrical acts, and gladiatorial sports. 

## Brutal Behavior
He divorced and kill his first wife, Octavia, making room his second wife Poppaena Sabina. He later kicked Poppeana to death regardless of her pregnancy because Poppeana suggested that he should spend less time at the horse races. He tried to get rid of her controlling mother by staging a boat accident. When this attempt failed, Nero quickly accused her of treason and ordered her execution.

## Fall of Roman Economy
After his mother's assassination, Nero became completely mad. He starts to devote more time to pursuing his hobbies. He wanted to regain the favor of the Roman. In his desperation to become popular, he spent most the Empire's reserve in his ventures, arts, music, and sports. To recoup the budgetary deficit, he explored three scams. (1) He sold public offices to the highest bidder. (2) He devalued the Roman currency by reducing the weight of silver coins by 20%. (3) He started to seize properties of the Romans.

## The Great Fire
Starting from the Senate, many seeks an opportunity to terminate Nero's reign. He discovered their plans so execute all who conspired against him. Nero extracted money from the populace to fund the makeover of his glamorous Palace. His debauchery and lack of self-control destroyed his positive reputation. The impacts of his financial choices were reflected in the Empire. He devised a scapegoat plan by setting a fire. The fire lasted six days and impacted 14 provinces, 3 were annihilated, 4 heavily damaged. After his fiddling, he proceeded to blame the matter on the Christians.

## Persecution Tactics
He became the first emperor to order mass persecution of Christian. His execution style begs for mercy. He organized execution circus sending wild beasts to devour the perceived enemy of the state. He also employed the favorite Roman capital punishment method--crucifixion. Under his reign, both Peter and Paul suffered martyrdom. In his cruelty, he would use Christian as lighting for his Garden, flaming them death.

## Last Days
In 68, the Senate started to revolt and waits for an opportunity to eliminate Nero. He fled. Once he realized that he had lost the allegiance of his generals. He committed assisted suicide exclaiming *"Qualis artifex pereo"* **(What an artist the world loses in me)**. In his 13 years as Emperor, Nero perfected the legacy of debauchery and anti-Christian persecution.

## Closing comments
Nero was full of talents. He was a poetic leader, a tactful actor, and skillful artist. In his last years, he manages to use his talents to his own destruction. He wisely discovered that "hidden talent counts for nothing"; however, he fails to employ his gifts constructively. His failures arise from his determination to pursue his selfish passions at the cost of others. What can we learn from his downfall? And How do you plan to reveal your hidden talents?
