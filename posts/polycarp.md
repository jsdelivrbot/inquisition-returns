![Polycarp's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/polycarp.jpg)
## Intro
Polycarp was born in Asia Minor in 65 A.D. around the time of Nero's persecution. After the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., the Christian persecutions ceased for about 20 years. Polycarp had the opportunity to study from the Apostle John, the beloved disciple. Polycarp labored in Smyrna as a bishop from the 90s until his death in 156 A.D. A preacher of the Gospel, Polycarp is remembered by his enemies as the destroyer of the gods.

## Doctrines
The doctrines of Polycarp reflected his love for the savior he worshiped. Polycarp believed that Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega and the Passover Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world. He believed in God the Father and God the Son. Polycarp, like the early Christians, viewed the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of God, that is the mind, the essense, or the breath of God. He did not assign any divine attributes to the Holy Spirit, neither did he view it as a divine being.

Polycarp preached of God's New Jerusalem that would He would bring down to earth after the 2nd Coming of Christ. Polycarp refused the philosophy of the soul's immortality. He believed that Christs’ followers will be resurrected to inherit the Kingdom of God. Polycarp encouraged his listeners to forsake idol worship and follow the teachings of Jesus. He also defended the Ten Commandments. He claims that God's character of love and justice is reveal in the moral law, the Ten Commandments. This belief led him to keep the biblical Sabbath and some of the Jewish fall holidays.

## Writings
In a letter to the Phillipians Polycarp exhorted his audience to good works and brotherly love. He started his letter with words of affirmations. He continued by sharing his sense of unworthiness. Polycarp brought to remembrance of the believers the writings of apostle Paul. Polycarp warned the readers about the "love of money." He reminded them of their duties as elders, deacons, and most importantly as believers. He closed by presenting Jesus Christ as the hope of glory for the militant church.

## Arrest
Polycarp knew how to share and defend his faith; however, he purposely hid from potential enemies. After he realized his death has warranted, he sought refuge twice in the neighboring cities of Smyrna. Polycarp became very influential. His influential preaching impacted the economy around the iconographic industry. His enemies set out to silence him. Three days before his death, he prophesied that he will be burnt alive. Soon after his prediction, he was betrayed by two members of his household, who suffered severe beating unto confession.

The soldiers and horsemen who were charged with his arrest found his hideout. They arrived on Friday evening around suppertime, in the opening hours of the Sabbath. Polycarp had his chance of escaping, yet he proclaimed "God's will be done." He welcomes the soldiers like old friends. He quickly and liberally provided them food and drinks. Polycarp requested one hour to pray. He prayed a powerful two-hour prayer. As a result the soldiers, full of regret, declared him a godly old man. After the prayer, the soldiers routed Polycarp to his trial.

## Trial
From the celebrating mob that followed the events, a voice of encouragement cheered "Be strong Polycarp, play the man." Even though the multitudes were rejoicing during the trial, the Proconsul tries to liberate Polycarp because was an old man at that time.

> **Proconsul**: Have respect for your old age, swear by the fortune of Caesar. Repent, and say, ‘Down with the Atheists!’ [meaning the Christian]  
> *Looking at the celebrating mob, Polycarp waved*  
> **Polycarp**: Down with the Atheists!  
> *Not exactly what the Proconsul imagined.*  
> **Proconsul**: Swear. Reproach Christ, and I will set you free.  
> **Polycarp**: 86 years have I have served him, and he has done me no wrong. How can I blaspheme my King and my Savior? 
> **Proconsul**: I have wild animals here I will throw you to them if you do not repent.  
> **Polycarp**: Call them. It is unthinkable for me to repent from what is good to turn to what is evil. I will be glad though to be changed from evil to righteousness.  
> **Proconsul**: If you despise the animals, I will have you burned.  
> **Polycarp**: You threaten me with fire which burns for an hour, and is then extinguished, but you know nothing of the fire of the coming judgment and eternal punishment, reserved for the ungodly. Why are you waiting? Bring on whatever you want.  
> *Fire was prepared and they try to fasten him with nails to prevent him from moving. He opposed.*  
> **Polycarp**: Leave me as I am, for he that gives me strength to endure the fire, will enable me not to struggle, without the help of your nails.  
> *Before his death, Polycarp prayed:*   
> **Polycarp**: O Lord God Almighty, the Father of your beloved and blessed Son Jesus Christ, by whom we have received the knowledge of you, the God of angels, powers and every creature, and of all the righteous who live before you, I give you thanks that you count me worthy to be numbered among your martyrs, sharing the cup of Christ and the resurrection to eternal life, both of soul and body, through the immortality of the Holy Spirit. May I be received this day as an acceptable sacrifice, as you, the true God, have predestined, revealed to me, and now fulfilled. I praise you for all these things, I bless you and glorify you, along with the everlasting Jesus Christ, your beloved Son. To you, with him, through the Holy Ghost, be glory both now and forever. Amen.

## Death
The fire failed to prevail against Polycarp. Instead of flaming him, the fire 'purified' him making his glow like gold. The fiery circles around the old man left his body untouched. Seeing that the fire failed to consume him, a command was given to pierce and kill him. An executioner thrust his sword into Polycarp's body, ripping his abdominal. Blood gushed out from the expiring old man and extinguish the fire.

## Letter to Smyrna
Smyrna, the persecuted Church, received a letter from the apostle John almost a century before Polycarp's death. While at Patmos, John receives inspired words to encourage the believers at Smyrna. The sacred letter reads:

> Unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write;
> 
> These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
> 
> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

## Closing comments
Polycarp's letter is to the Phillipians is phenominal; however, like many other writings from the early church Polycarp's letter failed to match the quality of Paul's letters. This simple fact testify for Bible's divine inspiration. Read Polycarp's letter to the Phillipians and compare it with Paul's letter to the same audience to draw your own conclusion.
