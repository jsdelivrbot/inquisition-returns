![Glimpses of the fourth cycle's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/fourth_cycle.jpg)
## Intro
Christianity had many up and downs during the fourth century. Like a roller coaster, the church's history during the fourth century was marked by opposing events. During the first three centuries, the persecuted church was in an unfavorable position with the Roman state. The fourth century denoted a different church, a church favored by the Roman state, a church with a persecuting zeal toward its declared heretics.

## The persecuted Church
At the dawn of the fourth century, the Roman Empire persecuted the church. The ruthless Diocletian attacked all those preaching the Gospel. His skewed view of Christ led him to crush the followers of the new religion. For Diocletian, sacrifice to the gods was a state priority and an obligation for each Roman citizen. Anyone who refused to adhere by this philosophy was considered an enemy of the Roman state. With this view came the most severe of Christian persecution.

## Empire persecutes Church
The church survived the 10 years (303 -313 A.D.) of persecution under Diocletian. With the Edict of Milan in 313 A.D., Rome started to tolerate Christianity. Emperor Constantine professed to have become a Christian. He gave them a legal status. With this legal status, the church organized Councils such as Ephesus, Nicea, and Constantinople to refine Christian beliefs that concerned the nature of Christ.

## Reliefs and compromises
By 320s A.D., millions of Roman became converted. As persecution ceased, many people joined the church. A subtle compromise took place. Paganism found its ways within the Gospel. As the pillars of the faith became refined, they became less biblical and more ecumenical. They presented a facade of acceptance, even to opposing doctrines of the Gospel. Many believers sacrificed to idols. They departed from the moral law, including the Sabbath to embrace the teaching of Constantine and adopt the conclusion from the ecumenical councils.

## Empire Challenges Church
By 363 A.D., Emperor Julian wanted to restore paganism in Rome. An empire-wide challenge came to Church. Julian renounced Christianity and launched a persecution against the church for two years. Even though such attempt remained unsuccessful at large, the church adopted many paganistic practices.

## Sectarian persecutions
By the middle of the fourth century, the church was no longer a marginalized minority. With the help of the Roman state, the church managed to control many parts of the Roman territory. After the ecumenical councils failed to solve the division inside the church, the Universal church leaned on the state to persecute its opponents. Starting with the Arians, the rising Universal church managed to uproot all who dared to oppose his establish doctrines.

## Theological advances
Many theological advances took place during the fourth century. In 397 A.D., the scripture of the Canon were recognized for their inspiration. This recognition did not create the scriptures, but simply confirm the received text that many Christian had relied on for more than two centuries, starting in the early 100s A.D. Despite recognizing the scriptures as revelation of God, the church found it more profitable to adopt many worldly practices.

## Expansion of the Gospel
The visible church became corrupt. Power and influence overrode the simplicity of the Gospel. Yet many were willing to face persecution for preaching the Gospel. A powerful evangelist in that era was Ulfilas. He took the Gospel commission to the Goths. The Goths had been known as a barbaric tribe in history; however, among their ranks many believing Christian had been obliterated from history. Almost all of their manuscripts have been destroyed when the Visigoths were uprooted in 538 A.D.

## Expansion of Church Corruption
With the legalization of Christianity came many deceitful practices. Many church offices unknown to the apostolic age were created. The church expanded his capital to Constantinople, a city named after Constantine. Instead of caring for the poor and going from home to home to give Bible studies, the church exploited both the poor and the rich. The alliance with the Roman state allowed the church to snatch many real estates. Libraries were built, pagan temples were remodeled to become mega churches, and great basilicas were created. This aggrandizement served as a distraction, hiding the growing tumor that was later diagnosed as the cancerous dark ages: corruption.

## Closing comments
The fourth century contained many significant events in church history. I can only highlight few historical events. Anyone who wants to learn more about the events surrounding the middle ages should revisit and study the church in the fourth century. Here is an address to this church in the Book of Revelation 2:12-17.

> And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write;
>
> These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; 
>
> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is:
> and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in
> those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you,
> where Satan dwelleth.
>
> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that
> hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock
> before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols,
> and to commit fornication. So hast thou also
> them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.
>
> Repent or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the
> sword of my mouth. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
> unto the churches;
>
> To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
> manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written,
> which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.
