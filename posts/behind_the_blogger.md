## Intro
The story of redemption started with the first Adam. After the fall, God made provision for humanity and promised to put enmity between the serpent and the seed of Eve. This journey of consistent faith plays throughout many centuries; each subsequent generation, from Abel down to ours, must side in this controversy by choosing to accept or reject the redemptive promise.

## Controversy
Abel obeyed God's command and suffered martyrdom from the hand of his own brother Cain. History teaching us of many like Abel that seal their faith with their blood. An actionable command was given to each patriarch: To noah, to build and arc; to Abraham to leave his country, to Moses, to face Pharaoh, and to us the message of proclaiming the fall of spiritual Babylon.

## Mission
We are pilgrims passing through. Our pilgrimage is not to Jerusalem, nor Mecca, nor Rome. We, like Abraham, are looking for a better country, that is an heavenly country. And desiring a city would builder and maker is God. This is very easy to overlook. At times, the things of this perishable world yearns for our attention and grasp our being. It remains important for us to internalize that we belong to a different jurisdiction. 

## Early years
The number of the years of my pilgrimage is 22. The first 14 spent in Haiti, my native land, where I learned many things concerning this world and the one to come. I attending a Baptist school and over the years developed a passion for history, math and science. Of history, mainly because of the *riche repertoire de l'histoire d'Ha√Øti.* Of science and math because they reveal the matters of the natural realm through *logos*.

## Looking forward
For the past eight years, I lived in the United States. I spend numerous hours analyzing the intricate connections between the filament that lighten *and facilitate* globalization. From western capitalism to Marxian economics, from autonomous technology to iron-steel manufacturing, from rapid-prototyping to large-scaled distribution, from outsourced production to stimulated consumption, I zigzag and walked the range of many concepts to rationalize and understand the evolving world. A quick-paced globe, rapidly changing with promise of the better future and prospect of a terrible one.

## Inspire, improve, serve
As concerning this great planet, there any many ways to make an to create a positif impact, and also many places and ideas to explore. For me, life is simple. I don't even have a bucket list. I know for sure that I'm trying to make dying the very last thing I do; yet, if death  fails to keep its end of the bargain and cross my path at an unexpected time, I hope to have lived an inspiring-life before God and men.

## Short bio
A Haitian by birth, an America by nationality, and software programmer by profession, I have no merit that I should brag. Yet through the promised seed, singular that is the *"second Adam"*, having obtained justification through his humiliating sacrifice and being made an ambassador for kingdom, Of him I will <s>brag</s> boast.
