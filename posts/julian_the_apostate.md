![Julian the Apostate's Quote](https://apps.wspecs.com/images/julian.jpg)
## Background
Julian in born in Constantinople in 332 to Julius Constantius and Basilina.
Both of his parents came from ruling families. His father was the brother
of Constantine. Constantius wanted to retain the thrones so he kills
all the relatives of Constantine who were heirs to the Roman throne.
His mother was the daughter of an Egyptian governor.


## Education
Julian studied under the leadership of eunuch Mardonius. He learned grammar,
Roman literature, and rhetoric. He continued in his learning of the classical
until he moved to Constantinople in 342. He later moved to Cappadocia. There
at the fortress of Macellum he received a Christian education.

## Early Career
Emperor Constantius, ambitious to keep the throne, II killed Gallus. The
Constantine dynasty being reduced, Julian was passively exile to Milan. After
further permission, he was allowed to move to Athens to further his study.

In the year 355, Constantius II had some major trouble with foreign troupes troubling him
from the River of Rhine. Desperate for help, he promoted his former exile
to the rank of Caesar. Julian was ordered to take out the Franks and Alemanni
tribes that were attacking the Rome from the west.

With very little military experience, Julian defeated its rivals. He gained
the confidence of his troop which aroused Constantius's hatred towards him.
In 356, he defeated Colonia Agrippina, and in later years the Alemanni near
Argentorate. These victories were seen as a threat by the emperor. Julian also
reduce the taxes of his citizen. The population of Gaul, where Julian resides,
wanted to proclaim him as emperor.

## Rise to the throne
In 361 Constantius died in a confrontation with the Persian. The determination
of the soldiers of Gaul to disobey his orders caused his death. After his
death, Julian become the sole emperor of Rome. No sooner than his ascension
to the throne did Julian decide to renounce all his ties to the Christian
God. He voiced his intentions to reestablish the worship of the pagan God.
This action gave him the name of Julian the apostate.

## Changes in the Church/State relation
After Julian became emperor, he cut all the benefits that the church covenanted
and enjoyed under the Constantine empire. Christians who help high offices
lost their privileges. Determine to show his disfavor for Christianity,
he turned to promote Judaism. Even though Julian deprived Christians the 
opportunity to serve in high offices, he was careful enough, and did not
publish any verdict against Christians.

Here an overview of his persecutions as depicted in Foxe's book of Martyrs.
> He recalled all banished pagans, allowed the free exercise of religion to
> every sect, but deprived all Christians of offices at court, in the
> magistracy, or in the army. He was chaste, temperate, vigilant, laborious,
> and pious; yet he prohibited any Christian from keeping a school or public
> seminary of learning, and deprived all the Christian clergy of the privileges
> granted them by Constantine the Great. 
> ### The execution of Basil
> Bishop Basil made himself first famous by his opposition to Arianism, which
> brought upon him the vengeance of the Arian bishop of Constantinople; he
> equally opposed paganism. The emperor's agents in vain tampered with Basil by
> means of promises, threats, and racks, he was firm in the faith, and remained
> in prison to undergo some other sufferings, when the emperor came
> accidentally to Ancyra. Julian determined to examine Basil himself, when that
> holy man being brought before him, the emperor did every thing in his power
> to dissuade him from persevering in the faith. Basil not only continued as
> firm as ever, but, with a prophetic spirit foretold the death of the emperor,
> and that he should be tormented in the other life. Enraged at what he heard,
> Julian commanded that the body of Basil should be torn every day in seven
> different parts, until his skin and flesh were entirely mangled. This inhuman
> sentence was executed with rigor, and the martyr expired under its
> severities, on June 28, A.D. 362. 
> ### Further persecutions
> The persecution raged dreadfully about the latter end of the year 363; but,
> as many of the particulars have not been handed down to us, it is necessary
> to remark in general, that in Palestine many were burnt alive, others were
> dragged by their feet through the streets naked until they expired; some were
> scalded to death, many stoned, and great numbers had their brains beaten out
> with clubs. In Alexandria, innumerable were the martyrs who suffered by the
> sword, burning, crucifixion and stoning. In Arethusa, several were ripped
> open, and corn being put into their bellies, swine were brought to feed
> therein, which, in devouring the grain, likewise devoured the entrails of the
> martyrs, and in Thrace, Emilianus was burnt at a stake; and Domitius murdered
> in a cave, whither he had fled for refuge. 

## Death
Like his predecessor, Julian fell at the hand of Persian calvary. He received
a hit from an arrow. And was stabbed by one of his soldier. His
body was exhume and taken to Constantinople.

## Closing Comment
How often do we see counsels in the bible that encourage us not to put our
trust in man? God command that his people put their trust in him and not
in princes, yet in all ages we see churches in apostasy reaching out to claps
hands with civil authorities to enforce their views. We also note briefly
through the story of Julian, union of church and state does not last long,
nor does it ever end peacefully.
