![Diocletian's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/diocletian.jpg)

After the death of his predecessor, he fought his way to the throne and claimed the name of Gaius Aurelius Valorous Diocletian as emperor. His reign started in 284 A.D and lasted in 21 years.

## Empire Reform
Diocletian started to reshuffle the structure of Rome. In 285, he started to divide the kingdom into to part and appointed Maximian as a Ceasar and give him control over the western part of the Roman empire. Later in 293, Diocletian founded the Tetrarchy, a ruling power comprised of four leaders. Another re-arrangement of the empire diminished the power of the regional governors. The number of provinces double. This increase inversely reduced the territory of the governors. Each governor simply acted as the *vicarius* of their respective tetrarchs. Each tetrarch controlled a territory. And all four territories had a capital city.

## Reinstitution of Idols
Rome's reformation extended beyond military reorganization. Diocletian re-instituted the traditional Roman religion. He wanted to return the worship of the gods. Diocletian started to enact laws requiring his general and officers to sacrifice to the gods. In 297, all the soldiers and administrators of the empire were forced to practice the ‘old cults.’ Any officer that refused to sacrifice lost their positions. 

## Persecution Returns
On February 24th 303, Diocletian enacted an edict to abolish the Christian religion. The edict commanded Roman generals to destroy all churches and to burn all religious scripture materials. This persecution for 10 years until the ‘Edit of Milan’ by emperor Constantine. In April 304, Diocletian required all citizen to worship Roman gods. Many Christian were executed for failure to comply with his request.

## Decline

Diocletian demanded more than honor, he wanted reverence. Diocletian declared himself as a living god. He obliged all to kneel before him and kissed his robe. In fear many citizens folded his demands. Some faithful believers opposed Diocletian. They did not bow down to him for they rather faced them worship a mere man. A year later Diocletian became really sick. He withdrew from power and renounced the throne.

Yet when denounced the God of Heaven and claimed divine attribute his health was taken from him. The powerful reformer could not even finish his reign, he retracted from the political Realm and died as a feeble worm in 311. A.D

## Closing comment
The ten years of persecution that started under Diocletian has been predicted more than 200 years before by the John the Revelator in his letter to the church of Smyrna. In bible prophecy, a day usually stands for a year. John boldly declared that Smyrna, the persecuted church, will be tried for 10 days. And it comes to pass as predicted. This revelation showcases the level of inspiration of the Bible.
