![Constantine's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/constantine.jpg)
## Intro
One of the most controversial figures in Christian history is Constantine the Great. This was the first Christian Roman emperor that publicly acknowledged the Christian faith as valid religion. His regulations and dictations in religious matter favored many Romans. Later, leaders of the Roman Catholic faith recognized Constantine as a saint. In contrast, protestant faith categorized Constantine as a compromiser, who facilitated pagan practices in Christianity. Constantine’s faith may be speculated upon; however, as an emperor he revolutionized the Roman Empire by ending Christian persecution temporarily.

Constantine the great was a military figure born of a Royal family in 272 A.D. His father led the western Roman Kingdom until 305. Constantine fought to gain and maintain power. He became emperor in 312, controlling the west of the Roman Empire at the time. In the same year of 312, Constantine fought a decisive battle for his kingdom—the Milvian Bridge on the Tiber River Battle. Before this battle, his scribes recorded that he had a vision. Constantine explained that in his vision he saw the ‘chi-rho’ sign, an abbreviation for Christ’s name. Constantine claimed that he heard a voice that echoed ‘in this sign you’ll conquer.’ Before the battle, he ordered the encryption of his army’s armor with the ‘chi-rho’ sign.

## Conversion
After this experience, Constantine decided to acknowledge the Christian faith as a valid Roman religion. He vocally accepted the Christian faith but postponed his baptism until later. Many doubt the reasons for his dramatic conversion not being sincere. Constantine was reminded of his forefathers, who  persecuted the Christian, and yet as emperors they had a horrible death. He diplomatically changed course upon Christian persecution. While many things remain unclear about Constantine new profession, one sign was clear. After the Milvian Bridge victory, Constantine declined to pay a visit the temple of Jupiter.

## Edict of Milan
Constantine started to change Roman Laws drastically in favor of Christians. Within a year of his reign, he enacted the Edict of Milan: It legalized the Christian religion. Before Constantine, Christianity suffered from external dangers, mainly persecution in various forms. During and post-Constantine, Christianity faced the most severe doctrinal dangers. The rising popularity of Christianity attracted many unconverted Romans. A settled and compromised faith erupted. Christianity mingled with paganism and apostasy blossomed.

## Apostasy
Romans become Christians and Christians became Roman. The line of demarcation between the two blurred. New converts maintained their sacrificial practice. Professing believers customarily visited the pagan temple. The writings of Moses were put aside. The testimony of prophets was neglected. The teachings of the apostles abandoned. Paganism shook hands with Christianity. Sound doctrine gently conceded his seat to culture. Human traditions dined with the sacred prescriptions. This apostasy continued for about a decade. Then in 321, Christian abandoned the biblical Sabbath, Saturday. With Constantine, they celebrated the “Venerable day of the Sun”, Sunday, in its place.

## Council of Nicea
Under Constantine Rome was Christianized and Christianity became apostatized. By 324, Constantine rebuilt the political seat of Rome at Christian Byzantium. Later, the city became known as Constantinople. In the same year Constantine united Rome under his reign. He became the sole emperor. In 325, He summoned many church officials at Nicea. At the council of Nicea, diverse discussions erupted on the nature of Christ. Nicea, is the first of seven ecumenical councils, which paved the way to doctrinal reconstruction. This doctrinal reconstruction paralyzed the Christian faith. Nicea facilitated the introduction of paganism and ignited the rise of the papacy.

## Effects of Church-State Union
In helping the church leaders find common ground for their faith, Constantine minimized both civil and religious liberty. The consented merge of opposite doctrines weakened the power of the gospel. Liberty of conscience vanished. Christians traded persecution for compromise. Even though the church flourished numerically, it shrank spiritually. Under Constantine, Christianity lost its zeal. Genuine faith died. Complacency settled. And apostasy continued throughout the year of Constantine’s death in 337.

History records no other civil ruler, who has brought so great changes in the church as did Constantine. He gave a new form of government to the church. In his model the government of the empire governed the church. He created offices in the church unknown to the New Testament, and he corrupted the doctrines and practices of the church. During his time, the Greek Church and the Roman Church merged and became the Catholic Church.

## Closing Comments
Under Constantine, the church membership increased while the member’s devotion to Christ decreased. This teaches us: We should be careful in associating church growth with spiritual growth. Constantine promised the freedom of worship. Yet his reign ended in deception for Christianity. He forced an apostatized Christianity on Rome. How can we learn from his reign concerning a union of Church and State?
