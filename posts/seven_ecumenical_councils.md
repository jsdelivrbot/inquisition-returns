![Seven Ecumenical Councils's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/ecumenical_councils.jpg)
## Intro
In the fourth century, many doctrinal discussions arose among the Christians. With the influx of unconverted believers, confessors of Christianity needed to find common doctrinal ground for their faith. Many started to depart from the simplicity of the gospel. Added to this departure was the indoctrinated additions of modern day philosophers to the apostle’s teaching. Many confusing interpretations arise apart from the prescriptions of scripture. 

## Background
Instead treading the ancient path, many church leaders feel obligated to pursue unity even by veering from word of the sacred council (the bible). Those leaders heaped up for themselves new convocations. They called forth councils hoping for an entente among diversified issues. By dispute and rhetoric, scholars, philosophers, and other religious advocate presented interpretations and ideologies that undermined the apostle’s teaching and power of the Gospel.

## Goal
The aim of the ecumenical dialogues was to unify all faiths into a universal one. The first council met in 325. By this time, in the early 4th century, Christianity underwent major reforms. Thanks to Constantine, the new popularized Christian faith embraced paganism. Converts departed from scripture. While claiming allegiance to Jesus, many hold to the previous beliefs. The church devotion’s to Christ at this time pale in comparison to previous generations. Paganism and Christianity embarked on a new journey. The seven ecumenical councils attempted to steer this deviation instead returning to the safe harbor of ‘thus saith the LORD’.

## Rise of Sectarian Persecution
In matters concerning faith, salvation of men, and the preaching of the Gospel, scriptural doctrine must triumph. The ecumenical councils followed a different course. When compromised dialogue failed to achieve the expected unification of the councils. Prominent Christian leaders retract to persecution to secure such union. Such actions enabled the emergence of the universal church, later known as the Holy Roman Empire. The church exerted a corrupted ecclesiastical influence. Sectarian forms of persecution erupted and continued throughout the ages. Christians so-called aided by local militia victimize believers who failed to subscribe to the outcome of dogmas derived from those councils.

## Methodology
The proceeding and intents of the ecumenical councils differed from the Jerusalem Council as recorded in Acts 15. Their conclusions and adoptions introduced subtleties that later mar sound doctrines. These council facilitated the rise of scriptural blindness. Believers started to rely more on scholars to speculate on the essentials pillars for the faith. Unlike the Jerusalem Council which concluded on scriptural principles from the prophets, the ecumenical councils rested on clarified dogmas. The councils' conclusive statements consisted mostly scriptural ambiguity, at least on the surface. 

### Here is a brief overview of their conclusion
* **Nicea (325 A.D)** - Asserted that Jesus is truly God and equal to the Father (Nicene Creed), Refuted *Arianism*.
* **Constantinople I (381)** - Revised the Nicene Creed, Defined the Divinity of the Holy Spirit, Refuted Macedonius
* **Ephesus (431)** - Declared Christ as the Incarnate Word of God and Mary as *Theotokos* (God-bearer), Refuted *Nestorianism* and *Pelagianism*
* **Chalcedon (451)** - Declared Christ as Perfect God and Perfect Man in One Person, Refuted *Nestorianism*, *Eutychianism*, and *Monophysitism*
* **Constantinople 2 (553)** - Formulated the Doctrine of the Trinity
* **Constantinople 3 (680)** - Asserted that Jesus had both a divine and human will 
* **Nicea 2 (787)** - Vindicated the veneration of images
 
## Derived Doctrines
The seven councils dealt with matters concerning the nature of Christ. The progression of these proceedings ended in outright apostasy. The decision of the last council plainly condoned the veneration of images, a precept that violates the God’s moral law. The councils which attempted to clarify the nature of Christ finished by presenting a picture of God that is unfamiliar with scripture. The trinity as debated and argued from the 5th council differs from the glimpses of God presented in the bible. 

Another fabricated concept from the councils is the deprivation of Jesus heavenly ministry as the advocate for sinners. A new hierarchy was established in which Jesus was characterized as a divine being whom we cannot approach. In turn, instead of praying to Jesus directly, Christians prayed to Mary, who forwarded their request to Jesus. The church became so corrupted that an earthly priesthood was re-established. And believers were summoned to confess to those priests. The priest would then intercede for those believers before Mary who would forward those request to Jesus. How absurd and how different from the Gospel as presented by Paul.

## Introduction of Apostasy
Nicea established the observance of the Pascha, a Passover-like holiday. Constantinople drew unbiblical conclusions concerning the state of the dead. Ephesus sanctified Mary, declaring her holy and worthy of adoration. Chalcedon declared infallibility of papal authorities. Constantinople 2 confused the characteristics of God as prescribed in scripture. Constantinople 3 deprived Christ of being our example in overcoming sins. Nicea 2 reframed idolatry as sacred.

## Unity?
Truth is the precursor of unity, not compromised. The ecumenical councils failed to accomplish their goals. Instead of uniting the church, they mostly introduced apostasy that weakened the Gospel. The councils further split the visible church. Persecutions arose because of the councils once the dogmas could not be enforced by entreaties. By 451, many of orthodox church from Asia and North Africa abandoned the apostasy of the so-called Holy Roman Empire, to find refuge and inspiration from the word of God. The law, the prophets, and the apostles were their safeguard. Those churches correctly reviewed the councils as bureaucratic exercises. 

## Closing Comments
The ecumenical councils relied heavily on documents, speech, and votes taken by a selection of bishops. This bureaucratic approach despite its intention failed to achieve unity. God’s word was neglected while humans’ counsels were praised. Ecclesiastical mandates should never supersede scripture. Our compass is the bible, not council votes.
