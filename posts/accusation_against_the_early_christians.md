![Accusation Against the Early Christians's Quote](https://inquisitionreturns.com/img/paul.jpg)
## Intro
In the early stage of Christianity, the believers in Christ suffered many persecutions. These early believers were ridiculed for their faith, yet they were encouraged by the hope the Gospel brings. They wholeheartedly believed in the message of Salvation. To many of these believers, the Gospel constituted of the very life they seek. In Jesus, they found  rest and peace that surpasses anything their world could offer. Many forsook the teachings of the Pharisees. Others broke with their idol worships. Some surrendered the cherished ideologies of their time to cling instead unto the everlasting Gospel.

Early Christian dealt with threats from three distinct groups. These threats seriously attempted to deracinate the root of the Gospel. They failed. Wherever the seed of truth found “good soil” it flourished and brought forth good fruits. At the religious level, the Jews set out to silence the Apostles. At the state level, Rome tried to regulate religious practices. At the Philosophical level, Gnosticism fought against the Gospel. But the Gospel prevailed. By the testimony of the apostles, and the “sure word” of prophecy, the “good news” of Salvation spread despite the persecution at all levels.

## Religious Threat
The Jews killed Jesus hoping to “save the nation.” A few weeks after Christ’s crucifixion, the disciples and many other believers waited for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. After Christ’s ascension, the promise of receiving the Holy Spirit was fulfilled. Peter assisted by other believers proclaimed the risen Christ. Many heard Peter’s reproofs and his call to repentance accepted the message of a risen Savior; however, most of the Pharisees and Saduccees repudiated Peter’s message of a risen Savior. They decided to hold onto their fabricated, traditional beliefs.

For more than 3 years (from A.D 31 - 34), the Gospel was solely preached to the Jews. Some believed the Gospel others reject it. The main point of rejection related to the divinity of Christ. Early disciples would testify of Christ’s resurrection. Many scholars at the time, namely the Sadducees, refuted any of such notions. The Pharisees, while they could not mitigate the influence of the early disciples, were determined to silence the Disciples of Christ at all cost. By God’s grace, the Gospel prevailed. And many were converted, confessing Christ as both Lord and Savior.

## Political threat
Judaism did not pose any hindrance to Rome’s power. In fact, while the Jews profess to wait for a conquering king they accommodated the demands of the Roman authorities. When Christ’s popularity started to draw the affection of the populace, the Sanhedrin intervened, hoping to "save" their nation. When the Gospel was preached to the Gentiles after the Stoning of Stephen, many Romans accepted the new light. By flocking to Christian believes and forsaking idol worship, these new believers drained the financial sector that depended on the worship of the gods.

During the early years, hundreds and sometimes thousands would convert in a day. This noticeable shift alerted Political authorities. They sided with influential and unbelieving Jews to persecute the early Christians. Starting with Herod Agrippa, many Christians suffered martyrdom. All the apostles, except for John who was in exile, were killed. The persecution continued under Nero, Diocletian, and many other Roman governors.

## Accusations
Christians were accused of cannibalism, incest, insurrection, and atheism. The accusation of cannibalism circulated because Christians professed to drink the ‘blood’ of Christ and eat the ‘body’ of Christ. In communion services, believers would eat unleavened bread and partake of grape juice as symbols for the blood and body of Christ. The accusation of incest arose because Christian gatherings occurred in "secret places" which were indoors by a bunch of people who call themselves "brothers and sisters." In Rome, religion equaled open sacrifice to the gods; anything else raised suspicion. The Christians were accused of atheism because they worshiped an unseen God, and of insurrection because they preached repentance and turning away from idols.

## Philosophical Threat
In the Antioch versus Alexandria exposition, Alexandria is known for ‘critical thinking’. Many philosophers would not accept the premise of Jesus’s birth and resurrection. Some based on their view of the gods opposed Christians for believing in Christ the divine. Gnosticism, deeply influenced by Platonism, challenged and ridiculed the early Christians. Starting in Alexandria, many thinkers, like Marcion of Sinope, formulated a hybrid faith. They fused their philosophical thinking with the apostles’ doctrine. This stance polluted the Christian faith. And this pollution continues over many centuries.

## Apologists and Evangelists
Many great minds attempted to defend the faith in Christ. The religious threat was opposed by the apostle including Peter and Paul. Many other evangelists followed and boldly proclaimed the Gospel, among those were Stephen, Phillip, Ignatius of Antioch, and Polycarp. Philosophers like Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian defended their faith, claiming it to be ‘true philosophy’. Even though the first two centuries consisted of many challenges, God never forsook his followers. Some died for the faith, others relocated due to persecution. The names of countless heralds of the faith in Christ are lost through history; yet through His story, that is Jesus’s story, they will be revealed.

## Closing Comments
Romans 7 and 8 contrasted two men. Both the men are under the disposition of the flesh. There is nothing magical about the man of Romans 8. While he has the same carnal disposition of the man in Romans 7, he simply brings every thought under the subjection of God. As we follow the example of the believer shown in Romans 8, we can also declare:

> For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Ro. 8:36-39.
