# Inquisition Returns Blog

While we temporarily enjoy the benefits of civil and religious, we should thrive to learn from history. Under the disguised of Christianity, many suffered tremendous persecutions through crusades, inquisition, and intimidation. Will this ever happen again? Let's retrace history!
